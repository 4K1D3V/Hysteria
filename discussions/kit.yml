## Shop and Grades

### Grades
We have three paid levels: VIP, MVP, and HERO. These tiers are shown in the tab as texture-specific icons that display a rank status for each of them: Silver, Gold, and Diamond.

### Prestige System
Prestige will take over standard ranks, which will be visible in a custom-made menu including five challenges for every prestige rank, and the further along you go up, they get tougher. Objectives include:
- Reaching a financial goal
- Spending a certain number of hours online
- Completing various tasks
- Voting a specific number of times
- Reaching a certain island level

### Prestige Levels
The different levels of prestige are:
- Bronze I, II, III
- Silver I to Silver III
- Gold I, Gold II, Gold III
- Diamond I, Diamond II, Diamond III
- Platinum I, Platinum II, Platinum III

Ranks themselves will be replaced by prestige levels and listed in the tab as colored icons; e.g., Bronze I, II, III, etc. But they will not appear in the chat. Only Paid Grades (VIP, MVP, HERO) will show in chat.

## Features

### Enhanced Chat Interaction
Hovering over a chat message will show the date and time it was sent. Left-clicking a player's message will automatically prepare the direct message command (/msg <player>).

### Fishing Zone
Designated fishing area at the spawn with a fisherman NPC that sells bait. A fishing kiosk where fish can be sold, with different rarities of fish based on how much they're worth. Better chance to catch rare fish in this zone.

## In-Game Rankings
